# Backstory

While using Chirp to try to manage settings for a few different radios, I noticed it wasn't really what I was after:

 - can create general lists of settings (only per-channel) in CSVs, but these general settings don't include some radio specific settings
 - copying between radios doesn't work well due to differing settings
 - channel grouping isn't portable between radios
 - tone & tx/rx configuration isn't structured well (ie: we shouldn't need split & cross)
 - no way to define custom convertions between different settings groups
